# === Core Libraries ===

torch==2.0.1
# PyTorch: deep learning framework used to define and train the PINN model

torchvision==0.15.2
# Provides datasets, transforms, and models for vision; required for compatibility with PyTorch
# (not directly used in your code, but often bundled with torch installations)

numpy==1.24.4
# Fundamental package for numerical computing with arrays and linear algebra
# Used in FD solver, meshgrid creation, and evaluation

scipy==1.10.1
# Scientific computing utilities — required if you later use solvers or signal processing
# (not strictly necessary unless you expand your model)

matplotlib==3.7.1
# Main library for plotting heatmaps, line plots, 3D surface visualizations, etc.

# === Optional: Jupyter Support (if using the notebook) ===

notebook==6.5.4
# Jupyter Notebook (Google colab) interface — required only if you want to run the .ipynb version

# === Environment Info (Optional, for full reproducibility) ===
# You may include the Python version in a separate environment.yml if using conda
# e.g., python=3.10

# === How to use ===
# To install all dependencies from this file, run:
